/ BANK ACCOUNT SYSTEM / 

/ Description /
This is a simple Bank Account System implemented in Python. The program allows users to create an account by entering their name and balance, and then interact with the account by performing the following operations :

Deposit funds into the account.
Withdraw funds from the account (provided the balance is sufficient).
View the account number.
The account number is generated randomly, and a basic command-line interface (CLI) is used to interact with the user.

Features
User input validation for name (alphabetic and spaces only).
Error handling for invalid choices, amounts, and withdrawal requests.
Random generation of a 10-digit account number.
Clear console-based interface for easier interaction.
